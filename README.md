# SchoolManagementWebsite
--WORK IN PROGRESS--Management website made using ASP.NET Web Forms. The site and the queries are meant to be used by cyrillic speaking users.

The site has a home page, enter page, register account page, register teacher record page. The teacher record page can be accessed only by authenticated users (logged in).

SQL Queries description :
1-Add database to the server
2-Add tables + populate dummy data
3-Create store procedures + views for getting and setting values.

In order to register account you need to know one of the teacher's "EGN", the data about the teachers is contained in "tblTeacherInfo".
Once created you can log in. In the future there would be separation between teacher and director and which sites they would be able to accesses.
